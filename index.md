## What's a Zine? 

"About 80 years ago the word “zine” came into existence as an abbreviated word from its parent term, “fanzine,” to describe fan based science-fiction pulps.   The genre, however, took off into its current form in the 1960s with radical activist movements and the punk rock music fanzines of the 1970s.  The photocopy machine replaced expensive and labor intensive mimeograph machines and propelled “printing” into a realm of accessible duplication.  Not a “magazine” or a “fanzine”, contemporary zines have become historic and personal narratives documenting people's stories and histories from all over the world.  They are used in education in many ways including: creative writing, instruction, as primary resources, community projects, and cultural awareness.  Digital technology has not killed print or zine culture, but has created online and open source spaces for zine communities to network and exchange information."

Look at some zines (circulate them and discuss): 

* Have you ever heard of zines? 
* Different kinds of zines: What styles do you see? Personal? Illustration? Typed? Topics? 
* Components of zines: paper, folds, binding, marks, visuals, writing, audience 
* By whom are they written? For whom? 

## Why a Zine Today about Technology Today? 

What can zines tell us about technology? How do they circulate? In what settings? Why might you make a zine about technology? 

## Make a One-Sheet Zine 

* Fold and cut a sheet of paper (octavo) 
* Prompt: in groups of two (no more, no less), make a zine for a student entering Grade 6 this year. Teach them *one* thing you think they should know about a specific technology. 
* Consider how you will share knowledge with someone else: lists, comics, examples, perspective, humour, style 
* Also consider some key topics: privacy, screen time, fun, (dis)connection, networks, FOMO . . .
